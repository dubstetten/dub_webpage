    Building their first sound in 2017, they gathered experience and started exploring their style. After all they realized, a custom sound system was necessary to deliver the experience they were looking for.
    Fueled by their pursuit for sonic excellence, they embrace their passion of roots & dub music to create unifying and intense moments of musical experience.
    referring to the UK’s 70’s „Roots & Culture“  sound system style, the artists are playing in front of the sound system. In comparison to modern DJ’s, every tune is played for itself without transitioning between them. 
    
    
    Traditional in this sub-culture is the so called „Dubplate“. It is a music production, you only can experience on the event itself because it is not released yet. 
    
    After years of playing dubplates & productions from other artists, they decided to release their own music.
